# Integrations

Qwik comes with built-in integrations to make it easy to connect to your favorite services, use your favorite styling or testing tools and deploy your aplication to common services such as Cloudflare, Netlify or Express server, and the [Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/static-site-generation/static-site-config/).

Once you create a Qwik City application, run the following command to add new integrations:

```shell
npm run qwik add
```

It will prompt you to select the integration you want to add. Once you select an integration, it will be added to your application and you can start using it.
